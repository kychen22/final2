Directions:

You will use the HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills that you have learned to create a personal website for yourself

Your website will consist of 3 files
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

These files will be linked together in your HTML file and work together to render your website

Ideas for information to put on your website:
- Your fullname
- A picture of yourself
- What school you go to
- What grade/year in school you are
- Your phone number and/or email
- A short bio about yourself
- Your hobbies and interests
- Your extra-curricular activities
- Your achievements and awards
- Other information about things you're interested in and passionate aboute
- some cool interactive elements for the user to play with so you can show off your javascript understanding

Style your website however you wish to express yourself and display your information (but try to use as many different html tags and styling options as you can!)

After you're finished building your website, you will upload this onto your github account in a new repository
- create a repository on github
- navigate to where you want that repository to live on your computer
- initiate your respository on your computer
- git diff
- git add .
- git status
- git commit -m "<your message>"
- git push

Go to your repository on github and verify that your code has been added to your repository

Go to settings of your repository

Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and enable. 

Github should then create for you a link so that you can view your website and share the link with your friends and family.
